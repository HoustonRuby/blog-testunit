[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/HoustonRuby/blog-testunit.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/HoustonRuby/blog-testunit)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/HoustonRuby/blog-testunit)

Created in July 2012 with the default Rails stack. No gems for you!

Things we missed the most: Capybara

Notes
-----

* We use an `assert_includes` in an integration test, so we can *only support Ruby 1.9.3*
